Mix everything well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Take a handful of the mixture and shape it into a long, cylindrical kebab. Repeat the process until all the mixture is used. If using wooden skewers, thread the kebabs onto the soaked skewers. Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. Grill the kebabs for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, or until they are cooked through and nicely charred. Alternatively, you can cook the kebabs in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 15-20 minutes. While the kebabs are cooking, prepare the chalow rice. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a pot, bring the water to a boil and add salt. Add the rinsed rice to the boiling water and cook until it is tender and fluffy, usually around 10-12 minutes. Drain the rice and set it aside. Once the kebabs are cooked, remove them from the grill or oven and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve the Chalow Kebabs alongside the fluffy chalow rice. You can also add some grilled vegetables or a side salad for a complete meal. Enjoy the delicious Chalow Kebabs with the fragrant chalow rice for a flavorful Afghan culinary experience!",

Cook for a few minutes until the flavors meld together. Place the fried eggplant slices into the pan with the tomato mixture, gently pressing them down to absorb the flavors. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the eggplants to further cook and absorb the sauce. In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. To serve, arrange the eggplant slices on a serving platter. Pour the yogurt over the eggplants, creating a layer of creamy goodness. Garnish with fresh cilantro or mint.
